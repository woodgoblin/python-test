Need to add the schema to DB model
setup/run is a bash script, is this the way really?
a way to further automate the environments? I feel that the envs separation using bash scripts is jury-rigged and lacks IDE support

Less crappy but anyway
need to add liquibase
need to remove test.db after test runs
